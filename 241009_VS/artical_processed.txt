published
in
the
february

issue
of
esquire
what
would
you
do
if
you
knew
this
was
the
last
night
of
the
world
what
would
i
do
you
mean
seriously
yes
seriously
i
don't
know

i
hadn't
thought
she
turned
the
handle
of
the
silver
coffeepot
toward
him
and
placed
the
two
cups
in
their
saucers
he
poured
some
coffee
in
the
background
the
two
small
girls
were
playing
blocks
on
the
parlor
rug
in
the
light
of
the
green
hurricane
lamps
there
was
an
easy
clean
aroma
of
brewed
coffee
in
the
evening
air
well
better
start
thinking
about
it
he
said
you
don't
mean
it
said
his
wife
he
nodded
a
war
he
shook
his
head
not
the
hydrogen
or
atom
bomb
no
or
germ
warfare
none
of
those
at
all
he
said
stirring
his
coffee
slowly
and
staring
into
its
black
depths
but
just
the
closing
of
a
book
let's
say
i
don't
think
i
understand
no
nor
do
i
really
it's
jut
a
feeling
sometimes
it
frightens
me
sometimes
i'm
not
frightened
at
all

but
peaceful
he
glanced
in
at
the
girls
and
their
yellow
hair
shining
in
the
bright
lamplight
and
lowered
his
voice
i
didn't
say
anything
to
you
it
first
happened
about
four
nights
ago
what
a
dream
i
had
i
dreamt
that
it
was
all
going
to
be
over
and
a
voice
said
it
was
not
any
kind
of
voice
i
can
remember
but
a
voice
anyway
and
it
said
things
would
stop
here
on
earth
i
didn't
think
too
much
about
it
when
i
awoke
the
next
morning
but
then
i
went
to
work
and
the
feeling
as
with
me
all
day
i
caught
stan
willis
looking
out
the
window
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
i
said
'penny
for
your
thoughts
stan'
and
he
said
'i
had
a
dream
last
night'
and
before
he
even
told
me
the
dream
i
knew
what
it
was
i
could
have
told
him
but
he
told
me
and
i
listened
to
him
it
was
the
same
dream
yes
i
told
stan
i
had
dreamed
it
too
he
didn't
seem
surprised
he
relaxed
in
fact
then
we
started
walking
through
offices
for
the
hell
of
it
it
wasn't
planned
we
didn't
say
let's
walk
around
we
just
walked
on
our
own
and
everywhere
we
saw
people
looking
at
their
desks
or
their
hands
or
out
the
windows
and
not
seeing
what
was
in
front
of
their
eyes
i
talked
to
a
few
of
them
so
did
stan
and
all
of
them
had
dreamed
all
of
them
the
same
dream
with
no
difference
do
you
believe
in
the
dream
yes
i've
never
been
more
certain
and
when
will
it
stop
the
world
i
mean
sometime
during
the
night
for
us
and
then
as
the
night
goes
on
around
the
world
those
advancing
portions
will
go
too
it'll
take
twentyfour
hours
for
it
all
to
go
they
sat
awhile
not
touching
their
coffee
then
they
lifted
it
slowly
and
drank
looking
at
each
other
do
we
deserve
this
she
said
it's
not
a
matter
of
deserving
it's
just
that
things
didn't
work
out
i
notice
you
didn't
even
argue
about
this
why
not
i
guess
i
have
a
reason
she
said
the
same
reason
everyone
at
the
office
had
she
nodded
i
didn't
want
to
say
anything
it
happened
last
night
and
the
women
on
the
block
are
talking
about
it
just
among
themselves
she
picked
up
the
evening
paper
and
held
it
toward
him
there's
nothing
in
the
news
about
it
no
everyone
knows
so
what's
the
need
he
took
the
paper
and
sat
back
in
his
chair
looking
at
the
girls
and
then
at
her
are
you
afraid
no
not
even
for
the
children
i
always
thought
i
would
be
frightened
to
death
but
i'm
not
where's
that
spirit
of
selfpreservation
the
scientists
talk
about
so
much
i
don't
know
you
don't
get
too
excited
when
you
feel
things
are
logical
this
is
logical
nothing
else
but
this
could
have
happened
from
the
way
we've
lived
we
haven't
been
too
bad
have
we
no
nor
enormously
good
i
suppose
that's
the
trouble
we
haven't
been
very
much
of
anything
except
us
while
a
big
part
of
the
world
was
busy
being
lots
of
quite
awful
things
the
girls
were
laughing
in
the
parlor
as
they
waved
their
hands
and
tumbled
down
their
house
of
blocks
i
always
imagined
people
would
be
screaming
in
the
streets
at
a
time
like
this
i
guess
not
you
don't
scream
about
the
real
thing
do
you
know
i
won't
miss
anything
but
you
and
the
girls
i
never
liked
cities
or
autos
or
factories
or
my
work
or
anything
except
you
three
i
won't
miss
a
thing
except
my
family
and
perhaps
the
change
in
the
weather
and
a
glass
of
cool
water
when
the
weather's
hot
or
the
luxury
of
sleeping
just
little
things
really
how
can
we
sit
here
and
talk
this
way
because
there's
nothing
else
to
do
that's
it
of
course
for
if
there
were
we'd
be
doing
it
i
suppose
this
is
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
world
that
everyone
has
really
known
just
what
they
were
going
to
be
doing
during
the
last
night
i
wonder
what
everyone
else
will
do
now
this
evening
for
the
next
few
hours
go
to
a
show
listen
to
the
radio
watch
the
tv
play
cards
put
the
children
to
bed
get
to
bed
themselves
like
always
in
a
way
that's
something
to
be
proud
of

like
always
we're
not
all
bad
they
sat
a
moment
and
then
he
poured
more
coffee
why
do
you
suppose
it's
tonight
because
why
not
some
night
in
the
past
ten
years
of
in
the
last
century
or
five
centuries
ago
or
ten
maybe
it's
because
it
was
never
february


ever
before
in
history
and
now
it
is
and
that's
it
because
this
date
means
more
than
any
other
date
ever
meant
and
because
it's
the
year
when
things
are
as
they
are
all
over
the
world
and
that's
why
it's
the
end
there
are
bombers
on
their
course
both
ways
across
the
ocean
tonight
that'll
never
see
land
again
that's
part
of
the
reason
why
well
he
said
what
shall
it
be
wash
the
dishes
they
washed
the
dishes
carefully
and
stacked
them
away
with
especial
neatness
at
eightthirty
the
girls
were
put
to
bed
and
kissed
good
night
and
the
little
lights
by
their
beds
turned
on
and
the
door
left
a
trifle
open
i
wonder
said
the
husband
coming
out
and
looking
back
standing
there
with
his
pipe
for
a
moment
what
if
the
door
should
be
shut
all
the
way
or
if
it
should
be
left
just
a
little
ajar
so
we
can
hear
them
if
they
call
i
wonder
if
the
children
know

if
anyone
mentioned
anything
to
them
no
of
course
not
they'd
have
asked
us
about
it
they
sat
and
read
the
papers
and
talked
and
listened
to
some
radio
music
and
then
sat
together
by
the
fireplace
looking
at
the
charcoal
embers
as
the
clock
struck
tenthirty
and
eleven
and
eleventhirty
they
thought
of
all
the
other
people
in
the
world
who
had
spent
their
evening
each
in
their
own
special
way
well
he
said
at
last
he
kissed
his
wife
for
a
long
time
we've
been
good
for
each
other
anyway
do
you
want
to
cry
he
asked
i
don't
think
so
they
went
through
the
house
and
turned
out
the
lights
and
locked
the
doors
and
went
into
the
bedroom
and
stood
in
the
night
cool
darkness
undressing
she
took
the
spread
from
the
bed
and
folded
it
carefully
over
a
chair
as
always
and
pushed
back
the
covers
the
sheets
are
so
cool
and
clean
and
nice
she
said
i'm
tired
we're
both
tired
they
got
into
bed
and
lay
back
wait
a
moment
she
said
he
heard
her
get
up
and
go
out
into
the
back
of
the
house
and
then
he
heard
the
soft
shuffling
of
a
swinging
door
a
moment
later
she
was
back
i
left
the
water
running
in
the
kitchen
she
said
i
turned
the
faucet
off
something
about
this
was
so
funny
that
he
had
to
laugh
she
laughed
with
him
knowing
what
it
was
that
she
had
done
that
was
so
funny
they
stopped
laughing
at
last
and
lay
in
their
cool
night
bed
their
hands
clasped
their
heads
together
good
night
he
said
after
a
moment
good
night
she
said
adding
softly
dear
